# 🎮 Stick Hero Game

A GUI-based Stick Hero game developed in Java as part of the Advanced Programming course (CSE-201). This project emphasizes object-oriented programming principles and provides an interactive gaming experience.

## 📖 About the Project

This repository contains the implementation of the Stick Hero game, created using Java's Swing framework. The game challenges players to stretch a stick to bridge gaps between platforms, testing their timing and precision skills.

## 🛠️ Features

- **Interactive Gameplay**: Engage in a dynamic environment where precision is key.
- **Graphical User Interface**: Built with Java Swing for a responsive and intuitive user experience.
- **Object-Oriented Design**: Utilizes classes and objects to model game entities and behaviors.
- **Modular Codebase**: Organized structure for easy maintenance and scalability.


## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: Ensure JDK 8 or higher is installed.
- **Maven**: For building and managing project dependencies.

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/pandillapelly22345/StickHeroGame_Project.git
   cd StickHeroGame_Project
2. **Build the Project**
   ```bash
   mvn clean install

3. Open Intellij IDEA and go to src -> main -> java -> com -> example -> cproject -> HelloApplication
   - Now Run this application this will run fine

## 🎮 How to Play

- **Start the Game**: Launch the application to begin.

- **Gameplay Mechanics**:
  - Press and hold the designated key to extend the stick.
  - Release the key to drop the stick and attempt to bridge the gap.
  - Successfully reaching the next platform increases your score.
  - Misjudging the stick length results in a game over.
